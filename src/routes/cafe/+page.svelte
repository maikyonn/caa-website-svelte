Welcome to Cal Animage Alpha’s maid café! I’m so happy you’re here (≧▽≦)

It would make me even happier if I got to see you all in-person 👉👈
I'll be waiting for you at Uji Time on Monday April 10 from 5-9pm, just a few blocks down telegraph from UC Berkeley campus - I’m super excited to serve you >////<

If you wanna support me and let me call you master, then purchase your tickets here: https://forms.gle/WvjqKsm1iRfGXkjMA °˖✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧˖°

For only $15, you can come and play fun games with me~ And if you bring 2 more of your friends I'll give you a special deal and let you buy 3 tickets for just $40 (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧

Besides having my full attention for an hour, each ticket comes with $10 worth of really yummy Uji Time food / drinks at a discounted price! Of course, if you want even more of our super delicious desserts, my friends at Uji Time will be happy to let you purchase to your heart's content ♡(◕ᗜ◕✿)
